    "This reports studies the northern Europe country Finland, and more specifically its 20 biggest cities, measured by population.  The overall large question to answer is \"_How do Finnish cities appear to someone willing to start a new cafe in Finland_\".  The business problem is further divided into two parts: first the overall understanding of finnish cities, and then in more detail any insight about cafe opportunities within these cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the audience... As already stated, the audience for this study is **anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit and cafe business creation intentions**.  This report is especially valuable information to immigrants in Finland with such intentions, as they do not necessarily have very good understanding of Finland to begin with.  However, this report will also serve native finnish people with same intentions, as usually people have a good understanding only of the nearby areas - in some cases more distant locations might provide more or better opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question of the overall understanding of finnish cities can be phrased as: \"**What are the characteristics that differentiate the cities and how each city compares to each other in relation to these characteristics?**\"  For example, is the population size the only differentiating factor between these cities, or are there also others, perhaps even more substantial characteristics?  Are there some characteristics that perhaps tell us something about the environment or the culture within these cities.  These characteristics can be used to identify potential needs in different areas, and help in profiling the new cafe service and finding it the best target audience.  For example, a cafe for university students and a cafe for construction workers may benefit from understanding the needs of these different client groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, more detailed question is \"**Which other factors correlate with the offering of these cafe services**\".  For example one assumption is that population should somehow correlate to the amount of cafes in the neighborhood.  The question then is, what factors seem good indicators - do the likes of education, income or presence of some other services nearby affect the demand for and offering of cafes?  The second question is to identify these factors.  Identifying these factors can then be used to search for good business locations.  For example, if these identified factors suggest that some area should have X cafes, but it has only Y, that area is perhaps a good opportunity for business.  \n"

So, if the result set for any postal code area has the maximum amount of 50 venues, it means we might not have received all venues there actually are.  In these situations, considering our target audience, we do three more download requests, this time focusing the additional requests with the _section_ attribute to values of _food_, _drinks_ and _cafe_.  This way we attempt to ensure that we should get at least most of the cafes and restaurants, if the location has a lot of venues close to the coordinates.

    "1. The **effect of the radius value on the explore result set**.  As the radius is slightly on the long side, we do end up in downloading some venues for more than just one postal code area.  This is not considered a problem for this study, it is just something to be aware of.  The logic is that if a venue is on the border of two postal code areas, it serves the people / businesses of both areas, and because of this proximity, it is ok to include it in both.  It is also acceptable as this rule applies to all postal codes, thus not just benefitting some.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The above note #1 is actually somewhat inevitable, as the **postal code area shapes on map vary a lot** - they can be for example long and narrow or circular or square or shaped like a letter 'P'.  With this data it is not easily feasible to find out a venue's true home postal code area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data coverage and timeliness**: It is uncertain how well the foursquare venue data matches the actual venues in the location.  Some venues like cafes may have run out ouf business and new cafes may have emerged which are not visible in the foursquare data.  As we have no way of knowing, we just need to assume that the coverage is good, and that it is reasonably up to date."

    "\n",
    "1. **Time scale:** Some variable values are based on year 2016 data, some on year 2017 data.  This is not a major issue for this study, but this may affect the results a bit.\n",
    "2. Postal code **location information** is not latitude and longitude information, but instead X and Y information.  This is effectively an alternative coordinate system (or a measurement way), and it needs conversion to latitude and longitude values, before we can combine this data with Foursquare data.\n",
    "3. The coordinate values (X and Y) point to the **center of the postal code area**.  In some cases, this center location is not the same as one would intuitively expect.  For example, some city's center postal code areas X and Y may actually locate over a lake or in some other location, but this is due to the shape of the postal code area.  This is somewhat compensated for via the radius value, when looking for FourSquare venue data for that postal code area. \n",
    "4. **Small value filtering:** Some postal code areas are rather small in population or other metrics, and if the total is less than 30, then Paavo data does not contain the details for those areas.  This is something that we have to take care of when preparing the data.  After cleaning data from postal codes with too few samples, we are left with 2108 postal code areas.\n",
    "5. **This study focuses on the top 20 cities in Finland plus one smaller city as bonus: Savonlinna**, which is a midsized city busy at summer of vacation people, but not so busy at other times of the year.  After selecting only those postal code areas that relate to these chosen cities, we have 677 postal code areas to work with."

Such gaps could be present if the downloading process, which is essentially data selection process, is somehow biased or faulty.  To be precise, I wanted to check that the values used for Foursquare _explore_ endpoints _radius_ and _limit_ parameters did not cause any such problems.\n",

That is, despite the radius value many postal code areas have venues mostly further away than the radius parameter of the call.  Even the distance to the closest venues may be longer than the calculated radius for the postal code area, as can be seen from the blue area on the left side of the upper plot.\n",

That is, if a venue is returned to at least two postal code areas, then there is overlap on that venue and on those postal code areas.  This is to be expected because the postal code area shapes on map are quite irregular, and we have to approximate the queries to the center of postal code area and a straight line radius.  In areas where there are many venues, it may happen that the limit is reached before all venues are received.  Thus, overlap is a good sign that all venues have been received.  This analysis was done from two viewpoints: from venue and from postal code area viewpoints.\n",

This was attempted on both the top 20 cities alone, and also on all cities and counties (300+ in total), but neither gave us much anything to build on - vast majority of cities remained in one huge cluster almost regardless of the value of k. \n",

For example that the amount of young adults aged 25-30 (and more broadly, 20-30) correlate well with the amount of cafes.  So does higher education, and certain kinds of venues, like Sushi restaurants and arts, entertainment and recreation jobs and employment possibilities.  These results are hardly surprises if one thinks of the trendy cafe boom in the last 20 years in Finland, especially in cities and urban contexts.  Still, this data clearly supports it.\n",

Top 3 cities have characteristics that others do not, like the presence of very condensed city centers.  And cities outside the top 15 quickly start to look alike.\n",

That is, there can be environmental or other considerations that the used data does not cater for.\n",

But I still find myself questioning the usefulness of the venue data from Foursquare.  It is clearly not accurate in absolute numbers, as there are much more cafes for example that are entered into the service.  It may not be a problem, if it is still a good representation of what is out there.  But that is the question we can only assume - for example, how balanced the Foursquare user group is.  If majority of the users is young adults aged 20-30 years, that is likely to have an effect on what kinds of venues and how many get entered into the service.  And do the enter only their favorite venues?  Thus, more and other data sources would be an interesting addition to further this kind of study."
