    "This reports studies the northern Europe country Finland, and more specifically its 20 biggest cities, measured by population.  The overall large question to answer is \"_How do Finnish cities appear to someone willing to start a new cafe or restaurant in Finland_\".  The business problem is further divided into two parts: first the overall understanding of finnish cities, and then in more detail any insight about cafe / restaurant opportunities within these cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the audience... As already stated, the audience for this study is **anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit and cafe or restaurant business creation intentions**.  This report is especially valuable information to immigrants in Finland with such intentions, as they do not necessarily have very good understanding of Finland to begin with.  However, this report will also serve native finnish people with same intentions, as usually people have a good understanding only of the nearby areas - in some cases more distant locations might provide more or better opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question of the overall understanding of finnish cities can be phrased as: \"**What are the characteristics that differentiate the cities and how each city compares to each other in relation to these characteristics?**\"  For example, is the population size the only differentiating factor between these cities, or are there also others, perhaps even more substantial characteristics?  Are there some characteristics that perhaps tell us something about the environment or the culture within these cities.  These characteristics can be used to identify potential needs in different areas, and help in profiling the new cafe or restaurant service and finding it the best target audience.  For example, a cafe for university students and a cafe for construction workers may benefit from understanding the needs of these different client groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, more detailed question is \"**Which other factors correlate with the offering of these cafe or restaurant services**\".  For example one assumption is that population should somehow correlate to the amount of cafes in the neighborhood.  The question then is, what factors seem good indicators - do the likes of education, income or presence of some other services nearby affect the demand for and offering of cafes?  The second question is to identify these factors.  Identifying these factors can then be used to search for good business locations.  For example, if these identified factors suggest that some area should have X cafes, but it has only Y, that area is perhaps a good opportunity for business.  \n"

So, if the result set for any postal code area has the maximum amount of 50 venues, it means we might not have received all venues there actually are.  In these situations, considering our target audience, we do three more download requests, this time focusing the additional requests with the _section_ attribute to values of _food_, _drinks_ and _cafe_.  This way we attempt to ensure that we should get at least most of the cafes and restaurants, if the location has a lot of venues close to the coordinates.

    "1. The **effect of the radius value on the explore result set**.  As the radius is slightly on the long side, we do end up in downloading some venues for more than just one postal code area.  This is not considered a problem for this study, it is just something to be aware of.  The logic is that if a venue is on the border of two postal code areas, it serves the people / businesses of both areas, and because of this proximity, it is ok to include it in both.  It is also acceptable as this rule applies to all postal codes, thus not just benefitting some.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The above note #1 is actually somewhat inevitable, as the **postal code area shapes on map vary a lot** - they can be for example long and narrow or circular or square or shaped like a letter 'P'.  With this data it is not easily feasible to find out a venue's true home postal code area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data coverage and timeliness**: It is uncertain how well the foursquare venue data matches the actual venues in the location.  Some venues like cafes may have run out ouf business and new cafes may have emerged which are not visible in the foursquare data.  As we have no way of knowing, we just need to assume that the coverage is good, and that it is reasonably up to date."

    "Note the following about Paavo data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time scale:** Some variable values are based on year 2016 data, some on year 2017 data.  This is not a major issue for this study, but this may affect the results a bit.\n",
    "2. Postal code **location information** is not latitude and longitude information, but instead X and Y information.  This is effectively an alternative coordinate system (or a measurement way), and it needs conversion to latitude and longitude values, before we can combine this data with Foursquare data.\n",
    "3. The coordinate values (X and Y) point to the **center of the postal code area**.  In some cases, this center location is not the same as one would intuitively expect.  For example, some city's center postal code areas X and Y may actually locate over a lake or in some other location, but this is due to the shape of the postal code area.  This is somewhat compensated for via the radius value, when looking for FourSquare venue data for that postal code area. \n",
    "4. **Small value filtering:** Some postal code areas are rather small in population or other metrics, and if the total is less than 30, then Paavo data does not contain the details for those areas.  This is something that we have to take care of when preparing the data.  After cleaning data from postal codes with too few samples, we are left with 2108 postal code areas.\n",
    "5. **This study focuses on the top 20 cities in Finland plus one smaller city as bonus: Savonlinna**, which is a midsized city busy at summer of vacation people, but not so busy at other times of the year.  After selecting only those postal code areas that relate to these chosen cities, we have 677 postal code areas to work with."

    "\n",
    "3. Time span of data: for Paavo statistics, we know the year for each variable, but for Foursquare venue data we cannot be certain how it matches the statistics.  For example, was the venue present in the location at the time of the statistics information?  Since we cannot know for sure, we need to assume that in general the timespans match _well enough_ - without being able to specify what is well enough.\n",
